8chan-tomorrow
==============

Just an 8chan theme based on Tomorrow

How to use
----------
Simply put 8chan-tomorrow.css content in your custom CSS or `@import url("https://rawgit.com/7185/8chan-tomorrow/master/8chan-tomorrow.css");` if you want to try the latest version (not recommended because longer loading times, but fine for a quick preview).

Remember to keep the default theme selected (Yotsuba B) in order to avoid conflicts with other themes. If that bothers you, have a look at my userscripts repo and use `same-css-everywhere.js` to completely ignore other themes.

Feel free to suggest anything.
